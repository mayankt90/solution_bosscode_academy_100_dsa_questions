############################################### Question #########################################################

'''
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.
You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Example 1:
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

Example 2:
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

############################################### Solution In Python ##################################################

#Solution 1

def reverseString(s):
    left = 0 
    right = len(s) - 1
    while left < right:
        s[left], s[right] = s[right], s[left]
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    return s

print(reverseString(["h","e","l","l","o"]))
print(reverseString(["H","a","n","n","a","h"]))
